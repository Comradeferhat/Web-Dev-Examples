# HTML & CSS Learning Project

This is a small project I built to **practice and strengthen my HTML and CSS skills**.

## What I did and learned:
- Used **semantic HTML tags** to structure the page properly.
- Explored how **block and inline elements** behave in terms of width and height.
- Applied **min-width, max-width, min-height, and max-height** to make elements responsive.
- Created flexible layouts and aligned items using **Flexbox**.
- Learned how **padding, margin, and the box model** affect the layout.
- Tried **CSS Nesting (nested selectors)** to write cleaner, more organized styles.
- Organized the project by creating **separate CSS files for each page**.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project was to **build a solid foundation in HTML & CSS** and practice practical layout and styling skills for future web projects.
